This is Task: Build a react application (using Redux).


I had a question, what values do you get when you send input value. In other words, if I send alphanumeric 1-10 symbols 
I get as a response val1 & val2, what should those values be? I did not get any response on that question so I made preliminary fetch data in the saga.
How it should be is commented out.

I hope this task doesnt get minus points for that.
